            <h2><i>Overview</i></h2>
            <p>It is hard to imagine a life without technology, much less the Internet. Over the last few decades or so, the Internet has had a global impact on mankind, one of those impacts being on the work force. Through the creation of the Internet, the work force has been changed <i> forever</i>.</p>
            <p>Through the Internet, the ability to find employment as well as the ability to become employed has skyrocketed. According to Patrick Thibodeau, senior editor for ComputerWorld, in 2009 the Internet had created over 1.2 <i>million</i> jobs (and that was <i>ten</i> years ago, can you imagine how many jobs it has created now?). That is 1.2 million people employed that might not have been before the creation of the Internet.</p> 
            <p>Not only has the Internet created new jobs that did not exist before, it has also made it significantly easier to find employment. Through websites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and many more, finding a job has become much easier and more efficient. People are now able to find potential jobs out in the world at the tip of their fingertips, all through this miraculous thing we call the Internet.</p>
            <p>The Internet has changed the daily lives of everyone, and one of the changes is in the work force. Without the creation of the Internet who knows what the employment rate would be in today's world. The Internet has had an extremely positive impact on the work force. So before scrutinizing all the bad that has come with advancement of technology, think of the good, such as the impact the Internet has had on employment. </p>
